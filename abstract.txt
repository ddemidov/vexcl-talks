VexCL: Experiences in Developing a C++ Wrapper Library for OpenCL

VexCL is a C++ vector expression template library for fast GPGPU prototyping
and developement. It provides convenient notation for various vector
operations, and generates OpenCL/CUDA kernels on the fly from C++ expressions.
The talk describes challenges met during implementation of the library and some
C++ techniques used to overcome those.
