VexCL: Vector Expression Template Library for OpenCL

VexCL is modern C++ library developed for ease of OpenCL developement. 
VexCL strives to reduce amount of boilerplate code needed to develop OpenCL
applications. The library provides convenient and intuitive notation for vector
arithmetic, reduction, and sparse matrix-vector multiplication. Multi-device
and even multi-platform computations are supported.  This talk is a brief
introduction to VexCL interface.
