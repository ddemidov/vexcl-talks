### Generating OpenCL/CUDA source code from C++ expressions in VexCL.

VexCL is an opensource C++ vector expression template library for OpenCL/CUDA.
It has been created for ease of GPGPU development with C++ and provides
convenient and intuitive notation for linear algebra operations, vector
arithmetic and various parallel primitives. This talk discusses C++ techniques
that VexCL uses to effectively generate OpenCL/CUDA compute kernels from user
expressions.
