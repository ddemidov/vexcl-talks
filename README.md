### VexCL - a Vector Expression Template Library for OpenCL


VexCL (https://github.com/ddemidov/vexcl) is a modern C++ library created for
ease of OpenCL development with C++.  VexCL strives to reduce the amount of
boilerplate code needed to develop OpenCL applications. The library provides a
convenient and intuitive notation for vector arithmetic, reduction, sparse
matrix-vector multiplication, etc.  Multidevice and multiplatform computations
are supported.

One of the major differences between NVIDIA's CUDA and OpenCL lies in their
handling of compute kernels compilation. In NVIDIAâ€™s framework the compute
kernels are compiled to PTX code together with the host program. PTX is a
pseudo-assembler language which is compiled at runtime for the specific NVIDIA
device the kernel is launched on. Since PTX is already very low-level, this
just-in-time kernel compilation has low overhead.  In OpenCL the compute
kernels are compiled at runtime from higher-level C-like sources, adding an
overhead which is particularly noticeable for smaller sized problems. At the
same time this allows to generate better optimized OpenCL kernels for the
problem at hand.  The VexCL library exploits this possibility through its JIT
code generation facility. It is able to convert generic C++ code to OpenCL at
runtime, thus reducing global memory usage and bandwidth.  This talk is an
introduction to the VexCL interface.
