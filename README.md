### VexCL: a Vector expression template library for OpenCL

OpenCL is the first open, royalty-free standard for cross-platform, parallel
programming of modern processors found in personal computers, servers, and
handheld/embedded devices. The weakest side of OpenCL is lack of tools and
libraries around it and the amount of boilerplate code needed to develop OpenCL
applications. The VexCL library tries to solve the latter issue. VexCL is
vector expression template library for OpenCL and has been created for ease of
C++ based OpenCL development. Multi-device (and multi-platform) computations
are supported. This talk is an introduction to the VexCL interface.
